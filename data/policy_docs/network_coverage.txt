Network Coverage Policy
Effective: January 1, 2024
Document ID: HG-NETWORK_COVERAGE-2024

======================================================================

**Healthcare Insurance Network Policy Overview**

**Out-of-Network Coverage:**
Our policy provides 60% coverage for out-of-network services. However, there are specific exceptions to this coverage that are important to understand:

- **Emergency Services:** If you require emergency care, we will cover 100% of the costs based on in-network rates, regardless of whether the provider is in-network or out-of-network. This ensures you receive the necessary care without financial burden during critical situations.

- **Geographic Limitations:** If there are no in-network providers available within a 50-mile radius of your location, you may be eligible for in-network rate coverage for out-of-network services. It’s important to verify provider availability in your area to take advantage of this benefit.

**Verification Process:**
To ensure that claims are processed correctly, please note the following:

- Claims for services rendered by out-of-network providers will be denied if the provider is not verified as in-network on the date of service (DOS). It is crucial to confirm the provider's network status prior to receiving care. 

- To verify if a provider is in-network, you can check our online provider directory or contact our customer service team for assistance.

We encourage all members to familiarize themselves with these policies to maximize your benefits and avoid unexpected costs. If you have any questions regarding your coverage or need assistance in finding an in-network provider, please do not hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. Your health and financial well-being are our top priorities.
