### Claims Processing Rules for Healthcare Insurance

To ensure efficient and accurate claims processing, the following rules are established. Adherence to these guidelines will facilitate timely reimbursement and minimize discrepancies.

#### 1. Timely Filing
- **Standard Filing Period**: Claims must be submitted within **180 days** from the date of service.
- **Coordination of Benefits**: For claims requiring coordination with other insurers, claims must be submitted within **365 days** from the date of service.

#### 2. Duplicate Detection
- Claims will be flagged as duplicates if they meet the following criteria:
  - **Same Patient**: Identified by unique patient identifiers.
  - **Same Date of Service**: The service date must match.
  - **Same CPT Code**: The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code must be identical.
  - **Same Provider**: Claims must be submitted by the same healthcare provider.
- Claims flagged as duplicates will require further review and may be denied unless additional supporting documentation is provided.

#### 3. CPT/ICD Matching
- Claims must include CPT codes that align with the corresponding ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes:
  - Ensure that the CPT code accurately reflects the services rendered and that the ICD code supports the medical necessity of those services.
  - Claims submitted with mismatched codes will be denied until corrected and resubmitted.

#### 4. Resubmission
- Providers may resubmit claims that require corrections within **60 days** from the date of the initial denial.
- The resubmission must include appropriate corrections and any necessary documentation to support the changes made.

### Additional Guidelines
- **Documentation**: Ensure that all claims are accompanied by the required documentation to substantiate the services rendered, including patient records and any prior authorization if applicable.
- **Electronic Submission**: Where possible, claims should be submitted electronically to improve processing times and reduce errors.
- **Contact Information**: For questions regarding claims status or specific processing issues, providers should contact the claims department directly using the contact information provided on the insurance card or website.

By following these claims processing rules, providers can enhance their claims accuracy and ensure they receive timely reimbursements for the services provided.
